 Lerning that sql stuff with an ORM.


Just spent a week learning SQL basics, now its time to forget it all and us js to manage sql with SEQUELIZE.

Sequelize is all about models. When using an ORM library like Sequelize, developers interact with a set of models to do database operations. Instead of interacting directly with the database, Sequelize acts as a mediator that oversees the movement of data from the database to the models and back.
